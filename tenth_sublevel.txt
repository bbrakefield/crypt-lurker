There
is
no
light
for
you...

...at
the
end
of
the
tunnel.

Your self-extinction
Suicide be thy name
Horrors blind to the dove
Shit on your blind and
Feeble innocence
Hovering over your false courage
Ghost hope and spent charity
Clinging to human frailty
Forces grind into your dove
A faith is lost you bring
With your scriptures
And when you kill yourself
Come visit me
Many spirits gather here.

Perseverance through this
Rite of purgery
Leaving your shit planet behind
Coldest of hells
Hatred of this world
Hatred of this life
The eyes of spectres
Which call to me
Infesting every moment
Invincible insanity
Unlife not meant for here
Never ending the sound
Rope creaking in mine night
The eyes of spectres
Which call to me
Reflecting every
Movement to die
"Come with us
You belong to us
Kill yourself
You deserve this."

When the winds come down
Cacophonous and vast
The crude skull whisper
The creature blackens same
And a thunder coils
To clear a path
Mine soul blackens free
Now, mine vessel is but dust
With a luminous clap
Now thunder
This thunder
Mine heart blackens true.

Contamination
Numbness
Throttling in the blackened river
Of time and insane
Swallowed again
Drown again and
Deranged parasites
And a metallic green odor
So full the emptiness
Aimless
Withered scales decorate its
Skin and its falling away
Twist and writhe serpentine
Treason and peril
Thrust down the kill
Its eyes gaze animus
Are again as before
Dead except the eyes
Treason and peril.

Hidden in plain sight
Uttering unheard volumes
A soliloquy of the shadow
Darkest broad day-light
Cut through deep
Now set it free
Cut through deep
From these depths
The gift and chalice
Pain must be the course
I must have this
Don the horns and the skull
Pain is the path.

Winds whip past the hull
Screaming through
Straight to your heart
The scent of your weakness
Excites this metal
I will meet you with war
Igneous links hiss
As the winds arise
Searing fear into your heart
The scent of your weakness
Ignites this metal
Charred remnants of
Foes past
Bitter taste of ash
Your whimpers feed the flame
The scent of fear
And searing flesh
I will meet you with war.

Nucleus extols ice
A black cloak of night-shape
Powers before the beyond
Becoming the tomb of the sun
Lifeless burnt-out sphere
Now frozen to black
And ice is wept by the sun
Stifled by crystal universe
Arctic pitch black pyre
Of this sky no more
Lifeless burnt-out sphere
Self destruction universe.

I bid the body farewell
Slumped down and cold history
A voice to drown out
Taken in mine own hand
A blade, a rope, bitter poison
Climb into the nil realm
Beyond mortal pain
Poison coursing through the veins
And all is end
Dripping pain as fire
Puncture this vessel with metal
Drift out and onward
Tenth rung of a ghost climb
From the murky depths
A final consciousness
Slumped down there
Cold and history
Now comes invisible
Poison courses through
Veins on fire
A throat crushed closed
Puncture this vessel with metal
Flesh gash release.


Take wings at Midnight,
Under glimpses of a uncertain Moon
Her thoughts become scarcely human,
They infest and cloud her mind
And she longs for this rotting ill,
And the grim bolt of her king
She waits in bestial desire to meet her master's last words
"Do you think I would except just any soul willing to give itself to mine power...
I torture and chastise you to ripen you for mine embrace...
Taking wings at midnight"

Your flesh is relic,
Your vessel obsolete
The zenith of Reality's hood
Where Infinity runs its course
Deeply Satanic vapors seep once more inside,
Your flesh is relics, your obsolete
Your blood will stain your gold
Beyond reason
Beyond intellect
Your idea of Hope

From the land of loveless
Knowledge born of Darkness
Mine Forest Burned to the ground
Burned to the floor long ago
Cutting the night from mine heart
Basking silent in hatred
Rinsing, Rising
Proselytized to hatred
Steal on the thiever
Bearer of 666 diseases
Fuck, with the night, into mine heart
Cut, with the night, into mine heart!!!

A Collision of violent jagged stones of dead
Beach and soft pale flesh and brittle bone
The sun sets over the bloddy scene
Her Screams of terror roll off the shore,
Where once she bathed her fragile skin in the sun
She is now penetrated by demonic force
Stones grinding her flesh to pulp,
Leaving her unable to run
Spilling Cunt blood on the waves,
Water runs it's course
In every orifice there stabs a stone
In every cut she bleeds to death
In every orifice of her own
She watches her last breath
Crushing her beneath it's jagged edge,
Splitting her open violently
The many stones plummet upon her flesh, beating her
Silently fucking her
A vicious beating of rocks and stones
Hardened earth takes her
Pounding thrusts crush her bones
Serrated edges breaks her

Crush the dried petals of roses that bore light
Brandishing talons at the sun
Yawning and empty the petals wither
Only grayed stem remains
Revive the silence that the stars will again shine
Weep not for chalice and not for lurking inspiration
But for relief from grace, finally with grasp
Constellation

An again the sea of wasted, wasted scent of Venus
Venus casts down the decry
Decry tainted spice red, red is the number of the spider
Spider's web rehearsed acidic
Acid creates the pattern
Pattern marked onto naked flesh and the flesh is now grass
Tall grass that cloaks the serpent, the serpent that which births the stone
The stone is inscribed with "law", but the "law" conflicts with virtue
And virtue sheds a 1,000 tears
Tears upon which you Trample, and drown becomin again serpent

Fear steals a voice
The price paid for dreaming
This is the cloud that lumbers across vision
A canopy of paranoia threatening light at its sting
Visions of existence appear and recede
For isn't it the end that makes passion rise
And isn't it the during that raises the chalice of tears

Hovering just above blind earth,
To join with her mist
Some never never embrace
Reach and grasp this frost-bitten heart
Stench and smoke bellow from under
Dispersed in dark womb of night
This gleaming harlot reflects the magician
And the child's horns mirror hers
Longing to travel with she
Skinless and away
Head thrown back in defiance
Belly thrust forward
Grotesque
A vagina full of feverish visions and the foul fiend peers from behind her eyes
A WHORE

Christ is lowered, needing thoughts to exist
A wicked time is at hand
This tone your holocaust
And virtue is for the dead
Cold cacophony surround you mind
Trade slavery
Slave traitor
Bloodied, chained and dying
Freedom is a vice of your mind
Born of idiocry
Among mountains of whispered lies
And the trails of the foe

With the fate of the muse unsure
Assumed ambiguous in rust
You depart toward death and war
So obedient
Back turned to the winter
You fashion this direction
Still the bleakness will not submit

The eye's sight scrapes back and forth against the frame of death mask slit
The mouth gurgles forth
A black matter thick and putrid
Naught ears detect the rattle
The hissing crackle of time
Space
The vessel convulses in rhythm with torment and space
Space
The air cuts the skins
Force now under
Bandages hands tear and pull at the chest cavity
Screamin all the meat away in a epileptic frenzy
Searching to not exit
The feet wait silent in a pool of excrement and blood and still the mouth gurgles forth
A black matter thick an putrid

Sorrow rains down, hatred reigns now
If satan be mine only audience
So shall it be
Misfortune
Ailment
A curse
Cave scorpions across the lips
A curse
As I cut mine flesh
I send this to you
As I bleed,
As I heal
I send you the misery of Existence
A curse
I see your stink
Cunt
Suffer

Heart replaced with stone and a necklace of scars

I plunge this equation into mine veins
Mine voice so far from mine voice
Mine hand so far from mine own hand
Voices from the angel on mine left thumb
Whisper terrible words and perversities

From a long flagellated vessel

Oh more, much much more is found of us
From the pandemonium
Begins the nativity of sin and death
Becoming most vain serpent
Everlasting perverse calculus

Heart replaced with stone
And a necklace of scars

From a long flagellated vessel

Now mine voice, mine hand, and mine heart
Herald the glorious becoming
The most vile of secrets
All of this troth
Given to mortification
Face down and obedient
Truths illuminated, no longer obscured
Full in emptiness complete
In wonder of malignant spirit
Impious yet desiderative
Plunge this equation into thy vein
Regurgitating on the crown of Sabbath

The essence of seraphim
Merging with sword, onto them
And the seamless garment like the morning
Dipped in the blood of men
Made as the filth of the world
And overwhelming to direct vision

Becoming the agents of torment
Veins filled with the serum of prophesy
Becoming the agents of torment
Eyes weeping the tears of prophesy
Become the agents of torment
Ears filled with the semen of prophesy

Ultimate acts of perverted intimacy
Nary a soul left without the punishment
Mountains now full of yours
Surrounded by their own graves
Let no warning sound from the trumpets of gold
Become the beginning of the end for the land of the living
Delivered to death those of the whole of the globe

From the death of all
Also claims those who call for it
And none shall escape this

Be as shadows amongst the nations
And cause great mourning

Wings upon wings upon wings
Cause men to die
Filled with iniquity and perfection
Swallowing the holy mountain of god
And its fiery stones
Incense down from capsized center
Raise this voice to the ashes of the world
Still hemorrhaging from the intoxication of rhema
Dwelling within the hand of desolation
Merging the sword, onto them
The heir apparent
And inflicter of delicious agony
The whole of the human race
Gone as T-lymphocytes

A glory that shines in every atrocity
Reveals itself in every vile act
Cleans itself in despondence
And the pit known only to broken men
Deafening are its secrets
Again attacking sanctity
With blasphemy and fornication
A law written as it is spoken
Past crooked lips
And the pit known only to broken men
Deafening are its secrets
Every particle of hatred
Sends direct for convocation
This world is for death
Parched and barren
Conduit to the suffering of the universe
And the grasp of its destructiveness
Cannot slumber
From this pit of degradation
Eyes, tongue and sword
Suckle at the honey
Sour, dejected and wretched
Risen above the calls of the flesh
Tearing deeper
Tearing deeper
And again the massive conspiracy against all life
No air
No exit
Futility is the first gradual
Then utter
All are, at once, taken to the destroying place

And under the crossroads
To keep the corpses down

Talons clutch high cheekbones
Phallus invades now swollen throat
A thorn reaches to fertilize the withered egg
Peril barbed and resistant
Emerging from tremendous heat
Primeval atom born of great fulmination
Gravitationally attracted to the forming matter

The inflation of the cosmos

Receive the world

Larva formed in glorious negativity
Another form readying the destroyer

The hideous is finally set forth

Face upturned towards the pillar that suspends Him
The brood of invisible ones shall never be named
Form without limbs readying the time end
The becoming of awe
Away from human frame

Form without limbs
Mouth beckoning the end of man
The unspeakable instrument will move through them

Reach within to see this free
And set fire onto me

And then the division
Division of most grotesque cells

Given to utter vexation and vulgar asceticism
Revealing in the blows
From the unseen accuser
Not only to bear witness
But attain evidence
Skin becomes to the tearing under fresh affliction
Sweat now mingles with the blood of gross hematuria

From the head
Down the back
Passing the thigh
For it is he that breath hatred onto censuring
And the stones are covered with this blood
Arms to torso and leg to leg
Now adhered with this

Each new blow
A echo of the last
Yellowed orbs rolling under these eyelids
The limbs give way

The last cry of joy
Forever and ever

Chin bobs the shoulder amidst great pallor
This figure is now folded and crimson

Arms and legs bound with pus and wax-like crust
Covering the feet of the accuser
This work is complete

Its essence lies dormant
Within every willing host
Waiting to release its malice
Waiting to spread perverse lies
Biding to crush and extinguish
Death stretches His arm
Across the whole of the globe
In His embrace
Blessed with blisters

Succumbing to its wounds
Every scar a joyous victory
Ever break open
Dispatching His ugliness
Across the whole of the globe
In embrace blessed with blisters
Depraved indifference to human life
Blessed with blisters
Now shown the fruits of suffering
And the grief of all that is made
Depraved indifference to human life
Blessed with blisters
Walking the fire
Behold and shine with purpose

Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Rejoice
Awakened now and unmerciful
You shall have all nations in derision
Becoming the catalyst of indignation
March towards wicked transformations
Slither from mine pallet that I might maintain your living ash
Living ash
Consume them with your fire
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
With poisoned arrows
Consume them that they may not be
Enveloping them with delicious suffering
Rejoice
Flower of worms begats the sword shown the world of perfidy
Consume them that they may not be
And deliver much agony
The mass crucifixion of the sons of Adam
Dispatched by ignious ophidian
Constained abyssal order
Announcing the true fruits of the fall
Become the catalyst of indignation
Rejoice
And with terrible and tyrannical death
Oh, restore us again

His beacon severes vision
Again alight from under
Crossing out their eyes
All vision ignored
Erasing the murmurs
Not want an utterance
Name and shape still unrevealed
Stabbing at the years he holds this audition
Dismantling all vessels of labor
Stumbling to reach the inception
No more can we be found
For belief cannot be seen
It is the frequency of day
Commencing with dry stutters
Begins the nucleus
We are found no more
But a scarred key
And the altered ticket
And tremendous ficitons
Subterrestrial illuminations
We are found
No/thing
But one piece of his whole

Within highest praise
And sought subjugation
Within woe and squaller
Countenance ever fallen
Dawning
The leering break of day
And penitence
Unto gowns of sacrifice
Unscathed nor weary
The Gardens of Coprolite
The Gardens of Coprolite
All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up and like the wind our sins sweep us away
The Gardens of Coprolite
Deceiving within your own selves
Shunning libelous laws
Therefore, the word, not flesh, is lived
The Gardens of Coprolite
And again the staggering vomit vexations

Manifesting in the hearts of man

Recitation from tomes of trepidation
Peering up the frock of glory within wicked fields of calm
The lesions lessons
His image ever a reminder
Iconic respire
Thesis ever unaltered
Endless veils ever hidden
Now they have lifted the shrine
Passing the seed through fire

Visage of the abyss set against you

Holy! Holy! Holy!

Most savage of faiths
His mark

Holy! Holy! Holy!

Ever igneous tongue of eremitic gospels





The death of the gloaming

Ever your derision
Within a cocoon of falsity
Again turn mine place where knives lay
Turn it toward your laments
All encompassing compromise
Leech of leper lives
The gloaming is buried
Turn it toward your laments
Mine place where knives lay

Long repudiated tears

Flaming serpent of orbs
Fall unto the hands of this angel
Five hundred years tall
Unremoved of spirit
Flaming serpent of orbs
Five hundred years tall
Waiting certain and shorn
Within barren searches
Five hundred years tall
And unremoved of spirit
Dei Desertionem
Churning
Always growing
Churning
Always groaning
Roaming salacious and insatiable
Not destroyed by the glorious
Permitting most obscene tantra
Venenum Deus
How you knew the dusk
Ever
Divine courtesan

Dei Desertionem

Amidst these worn hearts
Increase pressure
Oh the diamond of misery
Jewel of such oblivion
Pacing again
Still no reply
For where purpose wilted
Loss and regret bloomed
Life after life
Learning no/thing
Within final extremity
Beside the last breath exhaled
And again pale to the center
Stumbling
Stuttering
Nil light reigns
Only tattered accusations
Paling to the comparison
Now utterly drained
And all wonder is banished
Life after life
Absorbing
Nothing

Tracing the circle; serpent's diamond
One and all now black
Maw overflowing with dense menses
Tracing the circle; serpent's locutions
Shiny the slattern form
Holiest of devourments
Sacred
Tracing the circle; serpent's thunderbolt
The acolytes of filth
Rinsed in vice and glorious knavery
Made as the filth of the world
In much fear and trembling
Head shorn in prophecy
Baptised in opaqueness
Slattern despot
Within such turpitude
Tracing the circle; serpent's thunderbolt
Mask of Lilitu
Readies the blade of Cain
Down diamond flights
But a single clutch of ashes
All tongues toward the void
Olding and encircling time
A saturn beyond mortal perception
Within her briar fortress
All are both
All are oblivion
All are alive
All are extinction
Attempts so tragic
Origin of ritual
Upon your knees
Singing
But still on your knees
Fraudulent Thaumiel
Colorless polycephalic evolution
Hanged by your own
Tighten the sword
Veil of mad spirits
Tethered in roily belief
And I can smell your fear again
Paralyzed by doubt
Writhing
Ever within your own consciousness
Trapped in division
Barren
Tethered in roily belief
Upon your knees
Singing
But still on your knees
